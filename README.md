This study aims to utilize technological means to develop an interactive learning tool that provides immediate feedback, helping students consolidate their foundational knowledge in mathematics and stimulate their interest in learning mathematics.

By designing and implementing a calculation assistance teaching system based on the C language, the system will be able to randomly generate arithmetic problems, including multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, while receiving students' input answers, automatically judging the correctness of the answers, and tracking students' answering situations, including accuracy rates and scores. Moreover, elementary school students have a strong curiosity, and some intelligent students may wonder how arithmetic problems can be generated randomly, thereby sparking their interest in programming.
